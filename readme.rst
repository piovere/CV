Curriculum Vitae : Rachel N. Slaybaugh

This repository contains my curriculum vitae source files and pdfs
of two versions: full and summary. 

In order to build my cv from the source, try pdflatex. You'll need the
accompanying resume2.cls file.

Conversely, I've included the pdfs so you can download the built versions directly.

Thanks for your interest.
Thanks also to Katy Huff, from whose repo I forked, and  toTrey Hunner, who
provided materials I adapted as well.
